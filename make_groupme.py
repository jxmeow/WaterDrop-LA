# Description: Script to help add volunteers to a groupme.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""* VERSION NOTES
 * 1. I am getting a lot of my reference code from here:
    https://github.com/yangzihe/GroupMe-Multi-add/blob/master/README.md
    They are using and older version of python, so I had to update some
    of the API calls, and library calls with the proper name.
 * 2. You will need to create a GroupMe developers account here:
    https://dev.groupme.com/session/new
    see instructions on how to do so.
 * 3. This script runs on python version: Python 3.13.3
 * 4. You will need the reuqests API from the following address:
    https://github.com/psf/requests
    tbh, you don't really need it if you got all the code and stuff from me.
    It will stay at this version until they update anything.
 * 5. Used the following for reference:
    https://dev.groupme.com/docs/v3
 * 6. For reference on installing the latest maintained version of requests,
    you can look here (but the instructions here are a little out of date):
    https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install
    It was really that you need to cd in "requests-main" and run python -m pip install .

#Developer account, and copy and paste their access token here.

#Constructing the path to the downloads folder. It is possible that the path
#is different, but this should be the default one.
download_path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Downloads')

#This is a tough one, because GroupMe no longer makes it clear what
#Group ID is.I was able to find it with the following API call:
#curl -X GET "https://api.groupme.com/v3/groups?token=<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
#The problem is that this is going to return EVERY chat you are in.
#Also this only works in Command Prompts (not terminals, and idk what the apple
#equivalent is.)
#Which makes it a bit difficult to figure out what it is.
#Alternativly, you can also go to the GroupMe chat, copy the link
#To invite someone, and you should be able to get the group id there
#It should look something like this:
#https://groupme.com/join_group/1234567890/7xeszbox
#Where the group id is 1234567890.
#See instructions on how to fill it out after.

#Users should download volunteer information from the Jotform Google Sheet and name it
#something like "volunteersNumbers.csv" 

#So the purpose of this function is to check the user's download folder for the most recent
#download of the "volunteersNumbers(n).csv" where 'n' denotes an arbitrary 'file with a same
#name' number. The motivation behind this function is so that the user doesn't necessarily
#need to maintain their downloads folder and can keep multiple iterations of
#"volunteersNumbers.csv" if they forget to rename or delete old files. Another motivation is
#to reduce the amount of file navigation on the user's end to give the user a friendlier
#program to run. -Jia (Which coincidentally happens to be Joe but the vowels are 'shifted up'
#by one position.

#Here, we define "newest_volunteer_information" to grab the most recent file containing
#volunteer information. It takes the path to the directory we want to search as an input and
#returns the path to a specific file. Or, in this case, it takes the path to the "Downloads"
#directory as an input and should spit out the latest "volunteersNumbers(n).csv" where 'n'
#denotes an arbitrary 'file with a same name' number.

    #Here, I decided to sort our list for only files containing a specific keyword. Since
    #folks will (hopefully) be remembering to rename the google sheet to "voluntersNumbers",
    #the .csv file they'll be downloading will also contain that in the name, followed by a
    #number if the user hasn't deleted their old files yet. I used the keyword 'volunteer'
    #but the word can be more specific if desired for accuracy.

    #user forgot to download the file for the current week's drop, we can compare the file's
    #path creation time (for Windows machines, may be dependent on system) to the current

The following function does absolutly nothing! It is just a troll! 🤣
Also, I found out that Windows supports emojis (which is the type of os this
code was developed on). 
Based on the minute at which this code is run, it will either do one of two things:
1. Print a stream of binary code to make the script look like it is doing more than what
it is actually doing (it looks like you are entering the matrix lmao)
2. A little jump scare to new users which will say that everyone's data is uploaded to
the dark web (it's not lol)
The troll displayed on the console depends on whether the minute is odd or even.
If you are teaching this script to someone, have fun trolling! 🤣
